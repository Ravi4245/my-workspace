    <h2>Why Learn AI?</h2>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing every corner of the modern world — from how we drive, work, and shop, to how we learn, communicate, and get healthcare.
         It's the technology behind voice assistants like Siri, recommendation engines like Netflix, and self-driving cars like those from Tesla. At its core, AI enables machines to mimic human intelligence, allowing systems to learn from data, adapt over time, and make informed decisions with minimal human intervention.
    </p>
    <p>
        This comprehensive course is designed to take you from foundational concepts to advanced, real-world AI systems. You’ll start with Machine Learning fundamentals like supervised and unsupervised learning, and move into deep learning where you’ll build neural networks using TensorFlow and PyTorch. You'll explore the fascinating world of Natural Language Processing (NLP), 
        enabling machines to understand and respond to human language using models like GPT and BERT.
    </p>
    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence is transforming industries — from healthcare and finance to robotics and automation. This course offers a solid foundation in AI, equipping you with the knowledge and skills to build intelligent systems and solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Learn about the evolution of AI, major breakthroughs in neural networks, and how cutting-edge models like GPT and CNNs are powering today’s innovations.
